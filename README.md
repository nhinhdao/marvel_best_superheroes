# MarvelBestSuperheroes

Welcome to _Nhinh_Dao_ first ruby gem :D. I wanted to make this CLI gem because I have been so into Marvel Superheroes movies lately. In my opinion, the webpage I scraped didn't have the most accurate rank but at least they have all the informations of individual superheroes. For the thorough sources, please visit https://www.marvel.com/characters

This gem provides a CLI to view top 100 Marvels superheroes of all time with informations included super name, real name, birthday, died, character type, gender, and powers.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'marvel_best_superheroes'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install marvel_best_superheroes

## Usage

Type the command below and follow screen prompts

    $ marvel_best_superheroes


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
